# Email_Class

This projects creates a multi-class classification of emails based on their metadata (such as date received, sender, number of characters in title and body). 

The code consists of two parts. The first one (Jupyter notebook) is exploratory and aims to describe the data used (including data quality, attributes description). The second (python files) includes the model and additional data manipulation functions in separate files (cleaning, feature engineering, encoding, etc.). The code is designed to be flexible - steps can be included or omitted as needed in the master code.
